## Galaxy Classification Dataset Fields

**OBJID** -
The unique identifier of the galaxy in the database, used to distinguish it from other galaxies.

**RA (Right Ascension)** -
The right ascension coordinate, similar to longitude on Earth, used to locate the galaxy in the sky.

**DEC (Declination)** -
The declination coordinate, similar to latitude on Earth, used to locate the galaxy in the sky.

**NVOTE** -
The number of votes received for classifying the galaxy into six categories. It indicates how many classifications each galaxy has received.

**P_EL** -
The percentage of votes classifying the galaxy as an elliptical type.

**P_CW** -
The percentage of votes classifying the galaxy as a spiral type with arms twisting clockwise.

**P_ACW** -
The percentage of votes classifying the galaxy as a spiral type with arms twisting counterclockwise.

**P_EDGE** -
The probability that the galaxy is an edge-on type (viewed from the side, appearing flat).

**P_DK** -
The probability that the galaxy is a dark galaxy or has a more obscure appearance.

**P_MG** -
The probability that the galaxy is a Magellanic-type galaxy or has similar characteristics, possibly referring to nearby galaxies in the local group (such as the Magellanic Clouds).

**P_CS** -
The percentage of votes classifying the galaxy as a classic spiral type.

**P_EL_DEBIASED** -
The adjusted vote for classifying the galaxy as elliptical, accounting for potential distortions or biases.

**P_CS_DEBIASED** -
The adjusted vote for classifying the galaxy as a classic spiral, similar to **P_EL_DEBIASED**, but for spiral galaxies.

**SPIRAL** -
A flag indicating whether the galaxy has been classified as a spiral.

**ELLIPTICAL** -
A flag indicating whether the galaxy has been classified as elliptical.

**UNCERTAIN** -
A flag indicating whether the galaxy has been classified as uncertain (it is unclear whether it is spiral, elliptical, or another type of galaxy).
